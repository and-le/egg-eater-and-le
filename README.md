# About
- This is the repository for CSE 231, Spring 2023, Egg Eater and Green Snake. This project is a compiler for a dynamically
typed language inspired by Python (hence the snake names).
- The required tests for the assignment are located in the `input` directory.
- The `tests` directory contains all of the tests used to validate the compiler.
